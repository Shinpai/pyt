# pyt - aka python twitch

--- 

The aim of this project is to create a simple desktop twitch client using python and the kivy UI framework.

If succesful, it will have features like: 
* new OAUTH login to your own twitch account
* ofc watch followed streams or search for streams
* no clutter bullshit, overlays or ads like the twitch webpage nowadays has
* simple login, watch stream, optionally view chat. and thats all.
